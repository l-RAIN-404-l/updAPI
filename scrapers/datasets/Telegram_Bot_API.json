Starting December 1, 2024 messages with video that are sent, copied or forwarded to groups and channels with a sufficiently large audience can be automatically scheduled by the server until the respective video is reencoded. Such messages will have 0 as their message identifier and can't be used before they are actually sent.\n\nSee earlier changes »\nAuthorizing your bot\nEach bot is given a unique authentication token when it is created. The token looks something like 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11, but we'll use simply <token> in this document instead. You can learn about obtaining tokens and generating new ones in this document.\nMaking requests\nAll queries to the Telegram Bot API must be served over HTTPS and need to be presented in this form: https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/METHOD_NAME. Like this for example:\nhttps://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11/getMe\nWe support GET and POST HTTP methods. We support four ways of passing parameters in Bot API requests:\n\nURL query string\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\napplication/json (except for uploading files)\nmultipart/form-data (use to upload files)\n\nThe response contains a JSON object, which always has a Boolean field 'ok' and may have an optional String field 'description' with a human-readable description of the result. If 'ok' equals True, the request was successful and the result of the query can be found in the 'result' field. In case of an unsuccessful request, 'ok' equals false and the error is explained in the 'description'. An Integer 'error_code' field is also returned, but its contents are subject to change in the future. Some errors may also have an optional field 'parameters' of the type ResponseParameters, which can help to automatically handle the error.\n\nAll methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive.\nAll queries must be made using UTF-8.\n\nMaking requests when getting updates\nIf you're using webhooks, you can perform a request to the Bot API while sending an answer to the webhook. Use either application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data response content type for passing parameters. Specify the method to be invoked in the method parameter of the request. It's not possible to know that such a request was successful or get its result.\n\nPlease see our FAQ for examples.\n\nUsing a Local Bot API Server\nThe Bot API server source code is available at telegram-bot-api. You can run it locally and send the requests to your own server instead of https://api.telegram.org. If you switch to a local Bot API server, your bot will be able to:\n\nDownload files without a size limit.\nUpload files up to 2000 MB.\nUpload files using their local path and the file URI scheme.\nUse an HTTP URL for the webhook.\nUse any local IP address for the webhook.\nUse any port for the webhook.\nSet max_webhook_connections up to 100000.\nReceive the absolute local path as a value of the file_path field without the need to download the file after a getFile request.\n\nDo I need a Local Bot API Server\nThe majority of bots will be OK with the default configuration, running on our servers. But if you feel that you need one of these features, you're welcome to switch to your own at any time.\nGetting updates\nThere are two mutually exclusive ways of receiving updates for your bot - the getUpdates method on one hand and webhooks on the other. Incoming updates are stored on the server until the bot receives them either way, but they will not be kept longer than 24 hours.\nRegardless of which option you choose, you will receive JSON-serialized Update objects as a result.\nUpdate\nThis object represents an incoming update.At most one of the optional parameters can be present in any given update.\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nupdate_id\nInteger\nThe update's unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain positive number and increase sequentially. This identifier becomes especially handy if you're using webhooks, since it allows you to ignore repeated updates or to restore the correct update sequence, should they get out of order. If there are no new updates for at least a week, then identifier of the next update will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially.\n\n\nmessage\nMessage\nOptional. New incoming message of any kind - text, photo, sticker, etc.\n\n\nedited_message\nMessage\nOptional. New version of a message that is known to the bot and was edited.

Specify an empty list to receive all update types except chat_member, message_reaction, and message_reaction_count (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used.Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to getUpdates, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.\n\n\n\n\nNotes1. This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up.2. In order to avoid getting duplicate updates, recalculate offset after each server response.\n\nsetWebhook\nUse this method to specify a URL and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified URL, containing a JSON-serialized Update. In case of an unsuccessful request (a request with response HTTP status code different from 2XY), we will repeat the request and give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns True on success.\nIf you'd like to make sure that the webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in the parameter secret_token.

For example, specify [\"message\", \"edited_channel_post\", \"callback_query\"] to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all update types except chat_member, message_reaction, and message_reaction_count (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used.Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to the setWebhook, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.\n\n\ndrop_pending_updates\nBoolean\nOptional\nPass True to drop all pending updates\n\n\nsecret_token\nString\nOptional\nA secret token to be sent in a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” in every webhook request, 1-256 characters. Only characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and - are allowed. The header is useful to ensure that the request comes from a webhook set by you.\n\n\n\n\nNotes1.

Serves as a great replacement for the Telegram Login Widget when the user is coming from Telegram. All the user needs to do is tap/click a button and confirm that they want to log in:\n\n  \n\n\nTelegram apps support these buttons as of version 5.7.\n\nSample bot: @discussbot\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nurl\nString\nAn HTTPS URL to be opened with user authorization data added to the query string when the button is pressed.

Short name of a Game to be returned, serves as the unique identifier for the game\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: After the user presses a callback button, Telegram clients will display a progress bar until you call answerCallbackQuery. It is, therefore, necessary to react by calling answerCallbackQuery even if no notification to the user is needed (e.g., without specifying any of the optional parameters).\n\nForceReply\nUpon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice privacy mode. Not supported in channels and for messages sent on behalf of a Telegram Business account.\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nforce_reply\nTrue\nShows reply interface to the user, as if they manually selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'\n\n\ninput_field_placeholder\nString\nOptional.

Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply to a message in the same chat and forum topic, sender of the original message.\n\n\n\n\nExample: A poll bot for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:\n\nExplain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.\nGuide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'.\n\nThe last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use ForceReply in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.\n\nChatPhoto\nThis object represents a chat photo.\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsmall_file_id\nString\nFile identifier of small (160x160) chat photo.

Requires no parameters. Returns basic information about the bot in form of a User object.\nlogOut\nUse this method to log out from the cloud Bot API server before launching the bot locally. You must log out the bot before running it locally, otherwise there is no guarantee that the bot will receive updates. After a successful call, you can immediately log in on a local server, but will not be able to log in back to the cloud Bot API server for 10 minutes. Returns True on success. Requires no parameters.\nclose\nUse this method to close the bot instance before moving it from one local server to another. You need to delete the webhook before calling this method to ensure that the bot isn't launched again after server restart. The method will return error 429 in the first 10 minutes after the bot is launched. Returns True on success. Requires no parameters.\nsendMessage\nUse this method to send text messages.

A JSON-serialized object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard, instructions to remove a reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user\n\n\n\nFormatting options\nThe Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, spoiler text, block quotations as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render them accordingly. You can specify text entities directly, or use markdown-style or HTML-style formatting.\nNote that Telegram clients will display an alert to the user before opening an inline link ('Open this link?' together with the full URL).\nMessage entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met:- If two entities have common characters, then one of them is fully contained inside another.- bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and spoiler entities can contain and can be part of any other entities, except pre and code.- blockquote and expandable_blockquote entities can't be nested.- All other entities can't contain each other.\nLinks tg://user?id=<user_id> can be used to mention a user by their identifier without using a username. Please note:\n\nThese links will work only if they are used inside an inline link or in an inline keyboard button. For example, they will not work, when used in a message text.\nUnless the user is a member of the chat where they were mentioned, these mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the bot in private in the past or has sent a callback query to the bot via an inline button and doesn't have Forwarded Messages privacy enabled for the bot.\n\nYou can find the list of programming and markup languages for which syntax highlighting is supported at libprisma#supported-languages.\nMarkdownV2 style\nTo use this mode, pass MarkdownV2 in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:\n*bold \\*text*\n_italic \\*text_\n__underline__\n~strikethrough~\n||spoiler||\n*bold _italic bold ~italic bold strikethrough ||italic bold strikethrough spoiler||~ __underline italic bold___ bold*\n[inline URL](http://www.example.com/)\n[inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)\n![](tg://emoji?id=5368324170671202286)\n`inline fixed-width code`\n```\npre-formatted fixed-width code block\n```\n```python\npre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language\n```\n>Block quotation started\n>Block quotation continued\n>Block quotation continued\n>Block quotation continued\n>The last line of the block quotation\n**>The expandable block quotation started right after the previous block quotation\n>It is separated from the previous block quotation by an empty bold entity\n>Expandable block quotation continued\n>Hidden by default part of the expandable block quotation started\n>Expandable block quotation continued\n>The last line of the expandable block quotation with the expandability mark||\nPlease note:\n\nAny character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character.\nInside pre and code entities, all '`' and '\\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character.\nInside the (...) part of the inline link and custom emoji definition, all ')' and '\\' must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character.\nIn all other places characters '_', '*', '[', ']', '(', ')', '~', '`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\\'.\nIn case of ambiguity between italic and underline entities __ is always greadily treated from left to right as beginning or end of an underline entity, so instead of ___italic underline___ use ___italic underline_**__, adding an empty bold entity as a separator.\nA valid emoji must be provided as an alternative value for the custom emoji. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker.\nCustom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment.\n\nHTML style\nTo use this mode, pass HTML in the parse_mode field. The following tags are currently supported:\n<b>bold</b>, <strong>bold</strong>\n<i>italic</i>, <em>italic</em>\n<u>underline</u>, <ins>underline</ins>\n<s>strikethrough</s>, <strike>strikethrough</strike>, <del>strikethrough</del>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">spoiler</span>, <tg-spoiler>spoiler</tg-spoiler>\n<b>bold <i>italic bold <s>italic bold strikethrough <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">italic bold strikethrough spoiler</span></s> <u>underline italic bold</u></i> bold</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">inline URL</a>\n<a href=\"tg://user?id=123456789\">inline mention of a user</a>\n<tg-emoji emoji-id=\"5368324170671202286\"></tg-emoji>\n<code>inline fixed-width code</code>\n<pre>pre-formatted fixed-width code block</pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language</code></pre>\n<blockquote>Block quotation started\\nBlock quotation continued\\nThe last line of the block quotation</blockquote>\n<blockquote expandable>Expandable block quotation started\\nExpandable block quotation continued\\nExpandable block quotation continued\\nHidden by default part of the block quotation started\\nExpandable block quotation continued\\nThe last line of the block quotation</blockquote>\nPlease note:\n\nOnly the tags mentioned above are currently supported.\nAll <, > and & symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML entity must be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< with &lt;, > with &gt; and & with &amp;).\nAll numerical HTML entities are supported.\nThe API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and &quot;.\nUse nested pre and code tags, to define programming language for pre entity.\nProgramming language can't be specified for standalone code tags.\nA valid emoji must be used as the content of the tg-emoji tag. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker.\nCustom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment.\n\nMarkdown style\nThis is a legacy mode, retained for backward compatibility. To use this mode, pass Markdown in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:\n*bold text*\n_italic text_\n[inline URL](http://www.example.com/)\n[inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)\n`inline fixed-width code`\n```\npre-formatted fixed-width code block\n```\n```python\npre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language\n```\nPlease note:\n\nEntities must not be nested, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.\nThere is no way to specify “underline”, “strikethrough”, “spoiler”, “blockquote”, “expandable_blockquote” and “custom_emoji” entities, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.\nTo escape characters '_', '*', '`', '[' outside of an entity, prepend the characters '\\' before them.\nEscaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first and reopened again: use _snake_\\__case_ for italic snake_case and *2*\\**2=4* for bold 2*2=4.\n\nPaid Broadcasts\nBy default, all bots are able to broadcast up to 30 messages per second to their users. Developers can increase this limit by enabling Paid Broadcasts in @Botfather - allowing their bot to broadcast up to 1000 messages per second.\nEach message broadcasted over the free amount of 30 messages per second incurs a cost of 0.1 Stars per message, paid with Telegram Stars from the bot's balance. In order to use this feature, a bot must have at least 10,000 Stars on its balance.\n\nBots with increased limits are only charged for messages that are broadcasted successfully.\n\nforwardMessage\nUse this method to forward messages of any kind. Service messages and messages with protected content can't be forwarded. On success, the sent Message is returned.\n\n\n\nParameter\nType\nRequired\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nchat_id\nInteger or String\nYes\nUnique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format @channelusername)\n\n\nmessage_thread_id\nInteger\nOptional\nUnique identifier for the target message thread (topic) of the forum; for forum supergroups only\n\n\nfrom_chat_id\nInteger or String\nYes\nUnique identifier for the chat where the original message was sent (or channel username in the format @channelusername)\n\n\ndisable_notification\nBoolean\nOptional\nSends the message silently.

Create games via @BotFather using the /newgame command. Please note that this kind of power requires responsibility: you will need to accept the terms for each game that your bots will be offering.\n\nGames are a new type of content on Telegram, represented by the Game and InlineQueryResultGame objects.\nOnce you've created a game via BotFather, you can send games to chats as regular messages using the sendGame method, or use inline mode with InlineQueryResultGame.\nIf you send the game message without any buttons, it will automatically have a 'Play GameName' button. When this button is pressed, your bot gets a CallbackQuery with the game_short_name of the requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user and the app opens the game in the in-app browser.\nYou can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please note that the first button in the first row must always launch the game, using the field callback_game in InlineKeyboardButton. You can add extra buttons according to taste: e.g., for a description of the rules, or to open the game's official community.\nTo make your game more attractive, you can upload a GIF animation that demonstrates the game to the users via BotFather (see Lumberjack for example).\nA game message will also display high scores for the current chat. Use setGameScore to post high scores to the chat with the game, add the disable_edit_message parameter to disable automatic update of the message with the current scoreboard.\nUse getGameHighScores to get data for in-game high score tables.\nYou can also add an extra sharing button for users to share their best score to different chats.\nFor examples of what can be done using this new stuff, check the @gamebot and @gamee bots.\n\nsendGame\nUse this method to send a game.
